Title | Time Traveler: Reinforcement Learning for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting
Problems | TKG (Temporal knowledge graph) extrapolation, unseen timestamps, unseen entities
Key Related Work | Static Knowledge Graph Reasoning, Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning
Solution | Reinforcement learning framework, policy network, agent named TITer, Inductive Mean for unseen entities
Results | 4 TKG datasets (ICEWS14, ICEWS18, WIKI, YAGO), train/val/test split by timestamps, comparison with other TKG models, outperformed all models except for ICEWS18, best results with Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@1/3/10.
